Introduction
The year 1757 is a milestone in India's history. Until the Battle of Plassey
in 1757 India had weathered many storms of foreign attacks, internal
dissension or other disasters. But the misfortunes imposed on India by
British conquest was far greater than any of its previous misfortunes.
England destroyed the basic framework of Indian society, without signs
of general revivification. India, ruled by Britain was alienated from its
endogenous heritage.
Practically from 1760, Indian resistance struggles began against the
exploitation and rule of the East India Company. Discontent first burst
out among the poorer and working people, mainly tribals and peasants.
In many cases, they were given leadership by segments of the dispos-
sessed, old chieftain, nawabi and land holding class.
The Nawab of Bengal, Mir Kasim, lit the torch of resistance in 1760
when he began protesting to the Company's Board President in Calcutta
against the high-handedness of the Company's officers. When the En-
glish did not heed Mir Kasim's protest, the latter promulgated a firman
in 1763 abolishing all internal trade duties in Bengal Subah. This was done to ensure that Indian merchants had
the opportunity to compete on equal terms with the British merchants, who had, previously, alone enjoyed
exemptions from such duties. The result was the Battle of Buxar (1764) between Mir Kasim and the British.
Although defeated, Kasim endeavoured to organize forces against the British as long as he lived.
In the south, the forces of nationalism was kept alive by Haider Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. They were the main
obstacles to the expansion of British empire in the Deccan. Even after Tipu fell on the ramparts, fighting bravely
to defend his capital, Seringapatam, his anti-British militant heritage was carried on by a son, a grandson and
even in the 20th century by his great grand daughter, Noor Inayet Khan.
While some of the indigenous ruling class were keeping alive resistance to English paramountcy in this way,
throughout the country, in innumerable scattered localities, the toiling poor were rising up in revolt. Fakirs and
sanyasins gave them leadership. These uprisings of the Chuars, Bheels, Kolis, Santals, Khasis, Jats and numer-
ous such rebel groups, and movements like the Wahabi and Faraizi jolted the colonial and feudal exploitative and
administrative arrangements of British imperialism. To appease the peasant revolt, the British had to make
some changes in its apparatus of revenue management.
The century-long anti-British government rebellions, divided and scattered as they were, which germinated anti-
British consciousness among the peasants and the urban poor, were woven together on a India-wide frame by
the sepoys of the Indian army. In an age which preceded the birth of the working class, these troopers
performed the duty of being the vanguard of anti-imperialist liberation struggle. In May 1857, first at Meerut
cantonment, then at Delhi, open mutiny broke out among the sepoys. In the bulletin issued by the rebel sepoys
in Delhi to the people, they wrote that the land had lost its freedom to the British; the common people were
impoverished and destitute; they were tortured by heavy taxes; there was scarcity of food and clothing; and even
women's honour was at stake. There was no limit to English oppression. How long would Indians submit to this
insult, misery?
The revolt was crushed, but anger against alien domination began to fester among Indians. The blood stained
experience of rebellions over far flung Indian regions left deep impressions on the minds of the common people
in the regions where the revolts took place. In the next phase of British rule, this created the atmosphere in
which the freedom struggle could proceed.

Meaning of Nationalism
Broadly speaking, the term "nation" stands for a very large group of people, who feel that they are bound by ties
of common race, common land, common emotions, common culture, common language and literature, common
history, common religion, common joys and sorrows, and common political aims and aspirations. A particular
nation may not have all these ties, it may have only some of them; but these should be strong enough to rouse
collective political consciousness among the people.
Nationalism is a feeling of oneness, togetherness and common consciousness based on political, historical,
religious, linguistic, racial, cultural, psychological and other factors in a state. It is a strong sentiment evoking "a
collective consciousness of fellowship". People roused by nationalism in a completely independent state,
constitute a nation.
The result of 1857 was an im-
portant turning point in India's
freedom struggle. Although the
British suppressed the revolt,
the spirit of freedom could not
be suppressed. Instead the In-
dians were further inspired to
carry on their struggle.
The British policy in India after
1857 was to a large extent in-
fluenced by her imperialistic de-
signs. Britian had to face the
different European powers like
France and Russia in their bid
for colonial supremacy.
The desire to defend their In-
dian empire and to promote
their economic interests often
led the British government to
commit aggression on India and
her neighbours.
The Three Phases of the National Movement
1. The Moderate Phase (1885-1905): The movement was confined to few educated middle class intelligensia who
drew inspiration from western liberal and radical thoughts.
During this period the Congress opposed the British through Constitutional methods and its demands were
modest.
2. The Extremists Phase (1905-1919) The movement became more militant. Swaraj or Self Government was its
goal. It gave rise to communal consciousness among the middle class.
3. The Final Phase (1919-1947) Purna Swaraj or Complete Independence was the goal to be achieved under the
leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and others by method of non-violence and non-cooperation.
Eventually it led to the partition of the country into two nations, India and Pakistan.

Ilbert Bill Controversy
Though the revolt had failed, it had created a feeling
of discontent and hatred among the Indians towards
the British. Indians became politically conscious and it
gave rise to a national awakening which led to the
national movement.
2. The Tribal and Peasant Movements (1857-1919)
British policies encouraged an influx of zamindars, their
representatives and money lenders into the tribal ar-
eas. These sections of the people exploited the tribals
with the backing of the British.
Vast sections of tribal people were transformed into
landless labourers and bonded serfs. This has a devas-
tating effect on tribal life. In course of time the tribals
were reduced to such abject poverty, that they had no
other alternative but to rise in arms.
Between 1756 and 1857 a large proportion of revolts
were led by petty rulers, tribal chiefs in hill regions,
and local landed military officers (poligars) in South
India. They were supported by peasants and soldiers.
The object of these revolts was complete annihilation
or expulsion of the British.
The uprisings were spontaneous and sporadic. No for-
eign agents were involved in the risings of the Santals,
the indigo cultivators or the Maratha peasants. The
peasants waged battles every inch of the way and
threatened the British imperialism.
A.O.Hume, the founder of the Indian National Con-
gress, had enough evidence to see the seething dis-
content of the masses.
Courage of Indigo Peasants
The war cry of the
indigo revolt was, "If
needed we will give
our lives but we shall
not cultivate in-
digo".
The courage of the
indigo peasants was
applauded by Harish
Chandra Mukh-
erjee who wrote in the "Hindu Patriot‚Äù(1860):
"Bengal might well be proud of its peasantry. In
no other country in the world is to be found in the
tillers of the soil the virtues which the ryots of
Bengal have so prominently displayed ever since
the indigo agitation has begun. Wanting power,
wealth, political knowledge and even leadership,
the peasantry of Bengal have brought about a
revolution inferior in magnitude and importance
to none, that has happened in the social history of
any other country".

The movements in the Santal Parganas after 1855
The Santal insurrection of 1855 proved to be bar-
ren in its results. Though the government intro-
duced important administrative changes, they
could scarcely remove the causes of the discon-
tent of the Santals. The causes of discontent were
due to the gradual weakening of the institutions
of Manjhi (headman), the enhancement of rent,
and the increasing control of money lenders.
Indigo movements (1859-1860)
Indian cultivators used to grow a plant called in-
digo which yielded the dye for bleaching cotton
cloth.
With the growth of textiles industry in Britian, there
was a great demand for this dye. The British mer-
chants, therefore decided to acquire lands from
the zamindars in Bihar and Bengal for indigo culti-
vation. The value of lands increased in the vil-
lages where indigo cultivation had been practised.
As the sale of indigo was highly profitable to plant-
ers, tenants were forced to grow indigo under a
system of oppression. Tenants were forced not to
grow anything else in the field except indigo.
The formation of the British India Association in
1851 for protecting people's rights and the criti-
cal attitude of the government towards the plant-
ers, encouraged the peasants to revolt. Their move-
ments were confined to local areas involving cer-
tain sections of Indian society. But towards the
latter half of the 19th century, the national struggle
for freedom began to take shape which ended with
India's independence on 15th August, 1947.
3. The Imperialistic Attitude of the British
The British had established a strong hold over the In-
dian Government and had introduced a uniform sys-
tem of government. National sentiments grew among
Indians and they were determined to put an end to
imperialistic attitude of the British.
4. Economic Exploitation
Indian economy suffered a great setback during the
British rule on account of the Industrial Revolution in
Britain.
In the first half of the 19th century England needed
raw materials and a market for her industrial
products. The economic policies of India in agriculture,
Sidho - Leader of Santal uprising
The most im-
portant major
rebellion be-
fore the Mutiny
was the famous
Santal revolt of
1855-1856 in-
volving a peas-
ant army of be-
tween "thirty
and fifty thou-
sand. All these
revolts were
crushed by the
British ruth-
lessly.

--- Page 5 ---
heavy industry, finance, tariffs, foreign capital invest-
ments, foreign trade were all geared to preserve the
British economy.
The British ill-treated the peasants by charging them
land revenue which they found difficult to pay. They
introduced the zamindari system which impoverished
the peasants class. The zamindars collected rents from
the peasants, paid it to the Government after keeping
their own share. Under the new land laws, a money
lender could charge a high rate of interest to the peas-
ants for his money. In case, the farmer failed to pay
back any loan the money lender levied a high rate of
interest or even got their land transferred to him in-
stead of the money.
The money lender exploited the peasant class and the
farmer grew poorer and poorer. Sometimes he had to
mortgage his land in order to pay the land revenue or
even give away his land to the money lender. The greed
of the money lender broke down the village economy
and finally uprooted the peasant class.
Even the Indian industry was affected by the British
economic policy. British industrialist were encouraged
to set up industries instead of encouraging native capi-
talist to raise industries. Indian labor was fully exploited.
The workers had no right and, they were made to work
on low wages.
Jute, tea and coffee industries were monopolised by
the British. Indian handicrafts were damaged, heavy
duties were levied on goods imported into England from
India. The policy of Free-Trade was responsible for the
destruction of Indian crafts and trade.
5. Racial Superiority or Discrimination
The Indians were discriminated on grounds of colour
and called the Indians 'heathens'. An attitude of arro-
gance and contempt towards Indians was developed
by the Anglo-Indian bureaucracy. They looked upon
Indians as half-negroes and half-gorilla who could ef-
fectively work under force only. The Indians were re-
ferred to as a nation of liars, perjurers and forgers.
The Europeans had their own exclusive clubs and rail-
way coaches, where Indians could not enter. The Indi-
ans were punished severely even for minor crimes,
whereas British Europeans were treated with utmost
leniency. They received nominal punishment even for
a serious offence.
This harsh attitude of the Europeans evoked a reaction
in the Indian minds alerted by the educated Indians.
There were frequent famines in India. A terrible
famine occurred in Orissa in 1866, where lakhs of
people died. The terrible famine in 1877 lasted for
two years affecting Madras, Mysore and other south-
ern and central areas. In 1943, the great famine in
Bengal killed about 35 lakh of people. During this
time a lot of food grains were hoarded and later sold
at an exhorbitant price. Thus, it meant a big gain to
the Government and the business community.

6. Unifying Features of British Rule
a. British Administration
b.
The British rulers maintained peace and orderly
government after the chaotic conditions of 18th
century. They maintained a highly centralised ad-
ministrative unit with top administrators like sec-
retaries of state and Viceroys.
Political unity
The British sword imposed political unity in India.
Despite imperial efforts to encourage communal
regional and linguistic differences, pan-Indianism
grew. The establishment of political unity promoted
the spirit of one-mindedness.
c. English - A Common language
With the spread of English language, English be-
came a lingua franca through which Indians from
different states could communicate easily..
d. Influence of Western thought
-The liberal and radical thought of European writ-
ers like Milton, Shelley, Spencer, Rousseau and
Voltaire inspired the Indian intelligentsia with the
ideals of democracy, liberty and nationality of the
American and French revolutions. As a result a
new middle class emerged comprising of profes-
sional persons such as doctors, professors, jour-
nalists, lawyers and others. This class was aware
of the events of the British rule and provided lead-
ership to the Indian National Congress.
e. Improved Communication
‚Ä¢
It would have been impossible to organise an all
India movement without proper network of rail-
ways and roads, the telegraph and improved postal
system and cheap means of communication which
the British provided. -
The introduction of railways in India revolutionised
the social and economic life of the people. Com-
munication became quicker and journeys more
comfortable and much cheaper.
The network of railways spread throughout India
helped to fight famines and made the Famine Code
a working proposition. The famine of 1896 had
been called the famine of work culture rather than
of food. Surplus produce of one area could be
reached to famine stricken area for distribution in
a quick manner.
In 1853 Karl Marx had
prophesised 'the railway
system will become in In-
dia truly the forerunner of
modern industry'.
Railway revolutionised
trade by making possible
production for a market
and the opening up of the
interior. The railways
helped the growth of a large export trade in raw
agricultural produce.

7. Cultural and Religious Movements
The growth of western education and India's contact
with western civilisation awakened the Indian mind to
the evils of social and religious practices.
The liberation of thought fostered a spirit of enquiry
and a rational approach to the socio-religious problems.
'Fifty years of English education brought greater
changes in the minds of the educated Hindus of Ben-
gal than the previous thousand years'.
Many Indians began to realise that social and religious
reformation was an essential condition for the all-round
development of the country. The backwardness of In-
dian society made a deep impression on the rationalist
thinkers and religious and social reformers like Raja
Rammohan Roy, Swami Dayananad Saraswati, Swami
Vivekanand, Mrs Annie Besant. They helped renew
pride in Indian religion and culture. Indians became
aware of their motherland. Dayanand said "India for
Indians", Tilak said "Swaraj is my birth right and I will
have it".
8. Sayyid Ahmad Khan and the Aligarh movement
Movements for socio-religious reforms were also stir-
ring among the Muslim community in the second half
of the 19th century. The movements took shape more
slowly as the Muslim upper classes had tried to avoid
contact with western education before 1857. It was
only after the Mutiny that modern ideas of religious
reform began to appear. The foundation of Muha-
mmedan Literary Society at Kolkata in 1863 gave a
new direction to the socio-religious movement among
the Muslims. It encouraged upper and middle class Mus-
lims to come into contact with western education.
From the very beginning Sayyid Ahmad devoted him-
self to the upliftment of the Muslim community. He
diagnosed the miserable plight of the Muslims to their
innate conservation and their antipathy towards west-
ern culture and education. On the other hand the Brit-
ish distrusted the Muslims as they were found to be
the mainspring of anti-British resistance during the
Mutiny.
To regenerate and rehabilitate the Muslim community,
Sayyid Ahmad set before himself the two-fold task of
bringing about a reapproachment between the British
Government and his co-religion ists and removing the
orthodoxy by the magic touch of western education. Like
Rammohan, he fought against tremendous odds and ul-
timately triumphed over superstition and orthodoxy.
Role of Samaj
The various Samajs' (Arya Samaj, Brahmo
Samaj, the Ramakrishna Mission) established
by the socio-religious reformers advocated the
removal of the purdah system, introduction of
the widow remarriage, abolition of polygamy
and early marriage, and provision of higher
education.
Though mainly confined to urban educated
groups, these movements by their universal ap-
proach infused a new spirit into the 19th century
religious life of Bengal. It also contributed to-
wards social and political regeneration of India
Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan
Sir Sayyid Ahmad was a
Muslim modernist who
appealed to reason to meet
modern needs and chal-
lenges.
In 1864 he established an
English
school at
Ghazipur. The following
year he founded the Sci-
entific Society for translating useful English
books on various subjects into Urdu.
The crowning achievement of his life was the
foundation of the Mohammedan Anglo-Orien-
tal College at Aligarh in 1877. The College
imparted liberal education in arts and sciences
through the medium of English language. It
proved to be the main vehicle in diffusing scien-
tific education to the Muslim community.
He also started the Mohammaden Educational
Conference as a general forum for spreading
liberal ideas among the Muslim community.
As a matter of fact, no single man did so much for
his community during the 19th century, as
Rammohan and Sayyid Ahmad did, respectively
for the Hindus and Muslims.

9. Literature of Protest and Patriotism
The 19th century produced great literary figures in the
history of India who made a passionate appeal to In-
dian history, Indian spiritual heritage and patriotic feel-
ing to break away from British domination.
a. Bankim Chandra: He stands pre-eminent among
the literary galaxy and made significant contribu-
tion to the development of patriotic feeling during
the last quarter of the nineteenth century. His name
is associated with the famous song Vande
Mataram included in his novel Anandmath which
had been the national anthem upto 1947. Vande
Mataram was the keystone of the arch of Indian
nationalism which inspired generations after gen-
erations to supreme self-sacrifice during the mo-
mentous days of the Swadeshi Movement.
b. Swami Vivekananda: The spiritual side of nation-
alism was voiced by Swami Vivekananda, a pa-
triot of patriots. He placed Indian nationalism above
everything else, and his appeal to spiritual regen-
eration evoked warm response from the millions.
c. Bal Gangadhar Tilak: The credit of bringing mili-
tant nationalism to the forefront undoubtedly goes
to Bal Gangadhar Tilak of Maharashtra. His slo-
gans "Home Rule is my birth right and I will have
it" echoed throughout the length and breadth of
India He organised the Ganpati and Shivaji festi-
vals to awaken mass consciousn
Through his paper Kesari, Tilak made passionate appeals to
the people to imbibe the virtues of patriotism, fearlessness and
sacrifice. He asked "Can you not be bold even when in the grip
of death?" In an article he bitterly criticised the policy of
prayer and petition and asked the people to redress their
grievance by force.

--- Page 9 ---
10. Progress of Science
The age of modern science in India began with the
advent of the British. They promoted the cause of
technical education by establishing two Engineering
Colleges, one at Roorki in the North Western Prov-
inces in 1847, and the other at Kolkata in November
1865. Lord Curzon did much to broaden the whole
basis of professional courses, such as medicine, agri-
culture, engineering, veterinary science and other tech-
nical branches.
The Indian Association for the Cultiva-
tion of Science, founded in 1876 at
Kolkata by Dr. Mehendralal Sarkar, pro-
moted the cause of advanced scientific
research. A rare and gifted individual,
Jagdish Chandra Bose, by his boundless
devotion to work, placed India in the sci-
entific map of the world.
11. Development of Press and Public Opinion
The Indian press after 1857 developed rapidly owing
to the increasing political consciousness of the people
and the establish-ment of direct telegraphic commu-
nication between India and Britain in 1860. The In-
dian Council Act of 1861 stimulated Indian interest
in political development.
The majority of the papers were written in vernacular
though a few of them were in English.
There was a rapid increase of vernacular papers in
other provinces as well. In 1876 there were about 62
such papers in the Bombay Presidency, about 60 in
the North-West Provinces, Awadh and the Central
Provinces, 28 in Bengal and 19 in Madras.
The professional quality of its editors, according to
Englishmen, compared very favourably with their coun-
terparts in London. The Indian Press reflected the pub-
lic opinion of the country. Their contribution in edu-
cating the people, in promoting political conscious-
ness and demanding increased participation of the
Indian in administration were far-reaching. On 31 De-
cember, 1868 the Amrita Bazaar Patrika thundered:
"The Bengalis are determined to oppose the tyranny
of Englishmen at every step".
The foundation of the Indian National Congress and
‚Ä¢ the growth of National consciousness sharpened the
tone of the Indian press.
Important Newspapers of the 19th century
1. The old Bengal paper 'Hindu Patriot' con-
tinued to be the leading journal under the
able editorship of Krishtodas Pal. The
paper wielded such immense influence that
even the government consulted this paper in
order to feel the pulse of public sentiment.
2. The 'Indian Mirror' in the English lan-
guage, founded by Keshab Chandra Sen
in August 1861, attained popularity for its
liberal social and political views.
1
3. The 'Bengalee', (in English) founded in
1862, became a vehicle of political propa-
ganda from 1879 under the editorship of
Surendranath Banerjee.
4. In 1868 the Amrita Bazaar Patrika, the
most powerful organ of national opinion
was published by Sisir Kumar Ghose
5. 'Kesari', a Marathi daily founded in 1881
became the guiding spirit of militant nation-
alism under Bal Gangadhar Tilak from
1887.
6. 'Hindu', started as a weekly in 1878 be-
came tri-weekly in 1883 and a daily from
1889.

--- Page 10 ---
12. Rediscovery of India's Past
Indians had lost self esteem and confidence because
of the high handed attitude of the British. They were
considered uncivilized people. Then scholars like Wil-
liam Jones, Max Muller, Marshall and Ranade made
Indians proud of their ancient art and architecture,
literature and philosophy. This rediscovery of India's
past roused the feeling of self confidence, patriotism
and nationalism among the people.
13. Repressive Policy of Lord Lytton
Various measures undertaken by Lord Lytton showed
that too much faith could not be placed in the British.
His short sighted policies further accelerated the move-
ment against foreign rule.
a. The maximum age limit for the ICS examination
was reduced from 21 to 19 years, thus making
impossible for Indians to compete for it.
b. The Grand Delhi Durbar of 1877 was held when
the country was in the grip of famine. Here the
Queen Victoria of England was proclaimed Em-
press of India.
c.
He introduced the Vernacular Press Act and In-
dian Arms Act (1878).
These acts provoked a great storm of opposition in
the country and led to the formation of various politi-
cal organisations to carry out anti-British propaganda
in the country and fan the fire of nationalism.
14. Ilbert Bill Controversy
The Ilbert Bill was a simple measure putting Indian
judges at par with the European in dealing with all
cases in the Bengal Presidency. Lord Ripon tried to
pass this bill in view of the fact that Indians were
now rising in the ranks of the judicial services.
According to this bill, the Indian Sessions Judges were
to be given permission to try Europeans who were
accused of crimes. So far, Europeans could only be
tried by special courts consisting of European judges.
But as the implication of the bill dawned upon the
Europeans, there was a huge outcry against it and
Lord Ripon had to finally withdraw the bill under pres-
sure. The European reaction to the bill was an act of
racialism and it became a crucial issue to the new,
enlightened Indian middle-class. In December 1885,
there followed the first meeting of the Indian National
Congress at Bombay. Thus, the Indian National Con-
gress was the political precipitation of the Ilbert Bill.
*
*
Lord Lytton
The Vernacular Press Act forbid the ver-
nacular papers to publish any material that
might excite feelings of dissatisfaction against
the Government, and this Act was not appli-
cable to English news papers. In 1882 this
Act was repealed by Lord Rippon.
The Indian Arms Act of 1878 made it crimi-
nal offence for Indians to carry arms without
license.
This Act was not applicable to the British.

--- Page 11 ---
Growth of Political Associations
Introduction of western culture in India led to the growth
of modern political concepts like nationalism, nationality,
political rights, etc. In the post-mutiny period Indian na-
tionalism developed and assumed an emotional character.
1. Raj Narain Bose, the pioneer of nationalism in Bengal
gave a clarion call to the cause of Hindu cultural heri-
tage and founded in 1866 a "Society for the Promo-
tion of National Feeling among the Educated Native of
Bengal".
2. In, Hindu Mela was established by Nabagopal
Mitra to promote national feeling and a spirit of self
help among the Hindus by promoting Indian products
3. In 1865 the first Indian organisation was formed in
England by Indian students like Pherozeshah Mehta,
Badrauddin Tayabji, W.C.Bannerjee and Manmohan
Ghosh. Directed by Dadabhai Naoroji, these students
founded the London Indian Society which ventilated
Indian grievances and opposed misrepresentation about
Indians in the English press.
4. The London Indian Society was soon replaced by East
Indian Association founded in London in 1866 by
Dadabhai Naoroji which provided information on all
Indian subjects to the British public and members of
parliament and voiced grievances and suggested re-
medial measures. The popularity of this association
led to the establishment of its branches in Bombay,
Calcutta and Madras in 1869.
5. In 1867 the National Indian Association was founded
by Mary Carpenter the famous biographer of Raja
Rammohan Roy.
6. In 1872 the Indian Society was founded by Anand
Mohan Bose in London.
7. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, another important politi-
cal organisation in Western India, was founded in 1867
by Justice Ranade. It awakened among the people a
consciousness of their political rights and urged them
to fight constitutionally for them.
8. The Indian League (1875): The Press gave wider pub-
licity to the Indian National Movement in the late six-
ties and early seventies of the 19th century.
In 1868 the Amrita Bazaar Patrika the most powerful
organ of national opinion was published by Sisir Kumar
Ghose in which he described the misrule of the English
Once a leading light of "Young Bengal" and
later a pillar of the Brahmo Movement, Raj
Narain Bose established in 1865 a patriotic
association called Jatiyo Gaurab Sampadani
Sabha.
This inspired Nabagopal Mitra, Gajendranath
Tagore and Dwijendranath Tagore to set up
every year Hindu Mela.
Upto 1880, 14 such Melas were held and contrib-
uted a lot to the growth of nationalism in the
country.
Activities of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha
The sabha from the start kept itself busy with the
problems of agrarian society.
1. It protested against the Vernacular Press
Act (1878),
2. It agitated against the Ilbert Bill (1883)
3. It demanded the introduction of local self-
government.
4. In 1884 it pressed for reform of the Legisla-
tive Council and of recruitment to the Civil
Service.

--- Page 12 ---
and declared parliamentary government in India
as the only solution to the problems.
Ghose also founded the Indian League in 1875 with
the help of progressive leaders which tried to stimu-
late a sense of nationalism among the people. Within
a year the league was merged with the Indian Asso-
ciation.
9. The Indian Association (1876): This association was
headed by Surendranath Banerjee and Mohan Bose
as the secretary. The Indian Association was meant
to be the centre of an All-India Movement.
The new political body was composed of lawyers,
professionals and educated middle class. By 1884,
this association had 44 branches. Apart from agitat-
ing for various reforms, this association fought for
the rights of the peasantry as they constituted the
basic foundation of the whole social fabric.
10. All India National Conference (1883): The controver-
sial Ilbert Bill of 1883 highlighted the need for a po-
litical organisation with an all-India character. The
Indian Association was, after all, a provincial
organisation. So in 1883 the All India National Con-
ference was called at Calcutta and attended by more
than a hundred delegates from all over India.
The second session of the National Conference was
held in Calcutta in December 1885 about the same
time when the Indian National Congress was held in
Bombay. Since both these bodies were formed on
the same lines, that is, to work for the public interest
and welfare of the inhabitants of India, the National
Conference merged with the Indian National Congress
in December 1886.
The Foundation of the Indian National Congress
It will not be correct to trace the origin of the Indian
National Congress to the efforts of a single individual
like A.O.Hume. The various political organisations in
different parts of India and the ferment of ideas had
prepared the ground, and the foundation of the Indian
National Congress in 1885 was only a visible expres-
sion of that national awakening.
It was left to Mr. Hume, a retired official of the Govern-
ment of India, to give a practical and definite shape
to an organisation of an all-India character.
W.C.Bannerjee popularised the view that the idea of
the Indian National Congress was a product of Lord
Dufferin's brain, that he suggested it to Mr. Hume
who undertook to work it out.

Objectives of the Indian Association
To create a strong body of public-opinion
To integrate Indian people on the basis of
common political intents
3. To promote friendly relations between Hin-
dus and Muslims
4. To let the masses participate in public move-
ments.

Dufferin's idea was to have a political organisation
through which the government could ascertain the real
wishes of the people and thus save the administration
from any possible political outburst in the country. Lala
Lajpat Rai maintained that the Indian National Con-
gress was organised to serve as a 'safety valve' for
the growing unrest in the country and to strengthen
the British Empire.
Hume asked for 50 volunteers to join in a movement
to promote the mental, moral, social and political re-
generation of the people of India. He secured the sym-
pathy and support of the government officials and public
men in India and England for the Indian National Con-
gress. Thus, the movement was a child of both En-
gland and India.
In 1885 the first Indian National Congress met at
Bombay under the presidency of Shri Womesh Chandra
Bannerjee.
The nucleus of the Congress leadership consisted of
men from Bombay and Calcutta who had first come
together in London in the late 1860s and early 1870's
while studying for the ICS or for law - Pherozeshah
Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C.Bannerjee, Manmohan
and Lalmohan Ghosh, Surendranath Bannerjee, Anand
Mohan Bose and Romeshchandra Dutt, who all fell un-
der the influence of Dadabhai Naoroji who was then
settled in England as businessman-cum-publicist.
Shortly before the inaugural session of the Congress,
Florence Nightingale wrote: "We are watching the birth
of a new nationality of the oldest civilisation in the
world. How critical will be its first meeting at Poona. I
bid it God-speed with all my heart".
How prophetic the words of Florence Nightingale were
to prove in the history of nationalism in India.

Raja Rammohan Roy: The Maker of Modern India
Between 1810 and 1820, he published numerous works on a wide range of subjects including
religion and politics. In 1830, Rammohan Roy travelled to the United Kingdom as an
ambassador of the Mughal Empire to ensure that Lord William Bentinck's Bengal Sati
Regulation, banning the practice of Sati, was not changed. In addition, he persuaded the British
government to Increase the Mughal Emperor's sliperid by ¬£30,000. In 1831, the Mughal
Emperor Akbar II conferred the title 'Raja' on him.
SOCIAL REFORMS:
In 1828, Roy set up the Brahmo Samaj, a reformist movement of the Hindu religion that aimed
at fighting social evils that were prevalent in the society. He opposed superstitious practices,
customs such as Sati, polygamy, child marriage, the rigidity of the caste system and sought
property inheritance rights for women. As a result of his work in fighting Sati, the governor of the
Bengal Presidency, Lord William Bentinck, formally banned the practice on December 4, in the
year 1829.
EDUCATIONAL REFORM:
Roy, who regarded education important to achieve social reforms, advocated Western Learning
in India. He was instrumental in setting up several institutions including the Hindu College in
Calcutta in 1817, in collaboration with David Hare; the Anglo-Hindu School in 1822; and the
Vedanta College, a synthesis of western and Indian learning, in 1826. He also helped establish
the Scottish Church College in 1830. His journal, the SAMBAD KAUMUDI that touched upon
various topics was very popular.
Raja Rammohan Roy started the first Bengali language weekly newspaper and also the first
newspaper in an Indian language. His Journal Sambad Kaumudi helped people form an opinion
about the issues affecting their daily life in British India. In 1822, Roy published the journal
Mirat-ul-Akbar in Persian.
His approach to Religion.

Roy set up the Vedanta College to spread his teachings of Hindu monotheism. In order to help
the Indians keep pace with the rest of the world he aimed at promoting subjects like
Mathematics, Geography and Latin which, he felt were necessary.
POLITICAL ACTIVITY:
He criticized unjust actions and policies of the British Government in India. He protested against
restrictions on the liberty of the press. He organised petitions signed by both Hindus and
Muslims against the Jury Act of 1827 to draw distinction between Christian and Non Christian
as regards judicial administration. He asked for East India Company's trading right and heavy
export duties on Indian goods to be abolished. He can be aptly called the "Father of Indian
Nationalism". In the words of Rabindranath Tagore, "Raja Ram Mohan Roy inaugurated the
---modern age in India. He was the father of Indian Renaissance and the prophet of Indian
Nationalism."
Jyotiba Govindrao Phule:
Jyotirao 'Jyotiba' Govindrao Phule was a prominent social reformer and thinker of the
nineteenth century India. He led the movement against the prevailing caste-restrictions in India.
He revolted against the domination of the Brahmins and struggled for the rights of peasants and
other low-caste people. Mahatma Jyotiba Phule was also a pioneer for women education in
India and fought for education of girls throughout his life. He is believed to be the first Hindu to
start an orphanage for the unfortunate children. He was against the varna system, the
rights and prinilages enjoyed by the Brahmins and the way there was a lot of
discrimination by
Childhood & Early Life:
Brahmins.
Jyotirao Govindrao Phule was born in Satara district of Maharashtra in 1827. His father,
Govindrao was a vegetable vendor at Poona. His father and uncles served as florists, so the
family came to known as 'Phule'

Social Movements:
In 1848, an incident sparked off Jyotiba's quest against the social injustice of caste
discrimination and incited a social revolution in the Indian society. He believed that
enlightenment of the women and lower caste people was the only solution to combat the social
evils.
Efforts Towards Women Education:
Jyotiba's quet for providing women and girls with right to education was supported by his wife
Savitribai Phule. One of the few literate women of the time, Savitribai was taught to read and
write by her husband Jyotirao. In 1851, Jyotiba established the first girls' school in Pune and
asked his wife to teach the girls in the school.
Satya Shodhak Samaj:
In 1873, Jyotiba Phule formed the Satya Shodhak Samaj (Society of Seekers of Truth). He.
held the Brahmins responsible for exploiting the non brahmins to maintain their social
superiority by suppressing the "shudras" and "atishudras" in the society. The purpose of the
Satya Shodhak Samaj was to remove caste discrimination and liberate the oppressed lower-
caste people from the stigmas inflicted by the Brahmins. Jyotirao Phule was the first person to
coin the term 'Dalits' to apply to all people considered lower caste and untouchables by the
Brahmins. Membership to the Samaj was open to all irrespective of caste and class.
Death:
'
Jyotiba Phule devoted his entire life for the liberation of untouchables from the exploitation of
Brahmins. Apart from being a social activist and reformer, he was also a businessman. He was
also a cultivator and contractor for the Municipal Corporation. He served as Commissioner of
the Poona Municipality between 1876 and 1883.
